        "In the code above, the 'dot_product' function calculates the linear combination of weights and inputs, and the sigmoid function transforms this linear output into a value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid activation function introduces non-linearity and ensures that the output is in a valid probability range. The error is then calculated as the difference between the actual label (instance[-1]) and the transformed output. This error is used in the perceptron learning rule to adjust the weights during training.\n",

        "In the provided code, using the predict function directly results in a binary prediction (0 or 1) based on a threshold. However, this approach comes at the expense of losing the continuous-valued output obtained by applying the sigmoid function, which is essential for calculating the error and updating the weights during the training process."
